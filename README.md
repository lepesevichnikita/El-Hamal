# Simple implementation of El Hamal encryption algorithm
## Second lab on the subject "Cryptography"

This is a simple implementation of El Hamal encryption algorithm.
Also it is simple solution on Python 3.7 and PyQt5 5.12

* You can see source code of keys generation and encryption/decryption process in 
[src/elhamal/elhamal.py](./src/elhamal/elhamal.py "El Hamal")
* QML views are stored in [resources/](./resources "resources") 
* Qt resource are described in [resources.qrc](./resources.qrc "resources.qrc")
* [make_resources.sh](./make_resources.sh "make resources") executes commands to build qt resources into
[resources_rc.py](./resources_rc.py "resources_rc.py")
